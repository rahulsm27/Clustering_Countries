## Problem Statment

- HELP International an NGO focused on fighting poverty around the world has managed to raise $10 Million funds. 

- It wants to identify countries in dire need of funds so as to prioritize fund spending



## Solution Approach

1. The socio economic parameters like child mortality , GDP per person, income, inflation etc. can be used to classify countries.
2. Countries doing very poor on these paraments can be identified and targeted for fund spending.
List of 167 countries along with their socio economic parameters was collected and used for analysis.
3. Three countries with high inflation were left out of analysis as its inflation figure were way too high and had a significant impact in analysis.
Remaining 166 countries were grouped using cluster analysis under different categories.
4. Though we are able to cluster countries into groups of  3 and 4 using different clustering techniques, the top 10 countries in dire need of funds remains same in both the analysis.
